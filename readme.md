# Course Tracking Back End

Course Tracking Backend is the backend (API and Model) for a SFU Course Tracking Website where users can plan their future academic schedules by seeing previous and future SFU course offerings. The project was implemented with the Model-View-Controller design pattern. 
The course data is given through a CSV file and parsed into the model built in Java. The API made with Java and Spring Boot lets the front end retrieve and edit the course data as it needs to.
